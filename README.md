# Flet API - DashBoard

## Welcome to my Flet project
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is based on a study that I'm doing by myself, all you going to see here is public to everyone, I didn't steal anything. Feel free to fork and make your own project.

## How to install?
You need Python 3.10+ to run this application.

> After validating that you have Python 3.10+, do the following below:
> ```python
>%> python -m venv .venv
>%> Linux: . .venv/bin/activate
>%> Windows: source .venv/bin/activate
>%> pip install -r requirements.txt (venv)
>%> flet run app.py -r -w (venv)
>```

## Why did I make this project?
Besides challenging myself, I just wanted to keep up with the technologies that Python has been offered to evolve around it, since I use Python most of the time, why not try Flet for the Front End? Of course, this project will receive more updates in the future until I think it's enough and it reached it's goal.
